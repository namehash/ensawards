        <p className="w-full">
          ENSv2 ready resolution was tested using the &quot;leaderboard&quot; feature. The app
          doesn't support the use of ENS names at all as the predictor identifier.
          <br />
          <br />
          While that's a key issue that this app is encouraged to improve, this best practice is
          applicable specifically to apps that already have an existing ENS integration and making
          sure existing integrations are ENSv2 compatible. Therefore, for this best practice we
          apply a rating of not applicable.
