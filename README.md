# ENSAwards

Welcome to the GitHub for [ENSAwards.org](https://ensawards.org/)

## What is the ENSAwards site about?
ENSAwards is a celebration of excellence in ENS integrations.

For a perfect ENS integration there’s many ENSIPs, UX best practices, and technical details to consider. New ENS capabilities and standards emerge frequently, too.

ENSAwards is currently an “Alpha” containing only initial “teaser” content. We will be working to develop a taxonomy of test case benchmarks for app developers to consider when integrating with ENS.

Looking to the future, we hope ENSAwards can act as a guide for developers seeking to build the best possible ENS integration into their apps. We also hope it serves as a fun and exciting showcase of epic ENS integrations!

## Who created ENSAwards?
ENSAwards is a product of [NameHash Labs](https://namehashlabs.org). App benchmarks and scoring is based on our assessments and is not officially endorsed by the ENS DAO.

## What is the prize for a top ranking on ENSAwards?
🏆 Epic clout! 🏆 or perhaps some [ENS Referral Awards](https://ensawards.org/ens-referral-awards) if you're building an app that contributes to registrations or renewals of .eth names.
